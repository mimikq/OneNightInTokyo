# Routes for Tokyo

### Usage:

**First off: BACKUP your current setup. This includes mappings.json, database, your dog, everything.**

1. Import the SQL file for all the pokestops - rm-tokyo-stops.sql
2. Copy the other files into your MAD setup - **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP**
   - If you know your way around the mappings.json, edit it to change your device name and such, or copy paste the walker/area section into your current setup.
   - Don't ask me if you don't know how to use it
3. Start up MAD and edit your mappings to reflect your setup. Assign your devices to the tokyowalker.
